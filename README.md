PATH FINDING
============
Path Finding is a small demo application to understand the behaviour of some classical graph traversal algorithms.  
The goal is to show the path, if there existed, from an origin 3-digit number to a destination number.  
Impossible numbers could be added to the path. Those represent numbers that cannot be visited anywhere in the path.  

Supported Algorithms

__QUICK GUIDE__
* Choose your desired folder location and clone the repo issuing  
`git clone https://github.com/marcos-sb/path-finding.git`  
The folder `path-finding` should have been created  

* Change directory to the one just created and maven install:  
`cd path-finding && mvn install`
